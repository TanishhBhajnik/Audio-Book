# Audio-Book
The Audio Book uses Pyaudio module to take user inputs as audio and performs the tasks which they ask to perform. Here, there is a few paragraphs already included. The Audio Book randomly takes any paragraph and starts reading it. It helps when you don't want to read a book and just want to listen.
